# Sonic-Rush-Bac-Tool
A tool for converting sonic rush .bac files to pngs

The bac file specs can be found [here](https://www.romhacking.net/documents/669/).<br>
This program is heavily based by [NotKit's sonic-rush-tools](https://github.com/NotKit/sonic-rush-tools) with the exeption of added subframe support.

Used tinke-ultimate's Ekona library and SONICRUSHAD plugin source code as a guide; tinke-ultimate is a fork of [Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke) and can be found
[here](https://github.com/TheBestNSMB/tinke-ultimate "tinke-ultimate").

# Usage
Drag and drop the .bac file you want to convert to the executable, it will immediately start converting the .bac file with all the frames and subframes to separate pngs. When the console prints "ended" you can close the program.

*Make sure you have the .NetFramework installed<br>
*If no file is dragged/opened with, the console will print "no file"
